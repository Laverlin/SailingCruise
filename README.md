### description

There is already a few nice sailing apps but this yet another one... =)   

This app has 
- Race Timer with ISAF starting sequence support 
- Cruise view (main)
- Laps view 

In **Cruise** mode you can see at one glance actual speed, bearing, max speed and avg speed for last 10 seconds. Also there is a set of helpful indicators, like GPS status, recording status and actual speed vs avg speed, which is very useful for sail trimming.
Moving average of bearing for last 10 sec. could be helpful in long distance cruise.   

In **Race Timer** mode you can see remaining seconds till start, actual time and speed. You can also adjust countdown timer by one sec up and down and down to next minute.

In **Laps view** you can see data - max speed, average speed, distance and time of last 20 laps  

Waypoint mode is under development.

### usage

   -- switch to Race Timer mode
